# Publishing and Version Management Restrictions

## Critical Publishing Rules

**NEVER** automatically execute any of the following commands or operations:

### Prohibited Version Commands
- `npm version patch`
- `npm version minor` 
- `npm version major`
- `npm publish`
- `npm run release`
- `npm run version:patch`
- `npm run version:minor`
- `npm run version:major`

### Prohibited Git Operations for Releases
- Creating version tags
- Pushing tags to remote
- Creating release commits
- Merging to main/master for releases

## Version Management Policy

- **Version bumping** must be done manually by the maintainer
- **Publishing to npm** requires explicit human approval and execution
- **Release process** should follow the established workflow in [package.json](mdc:package.json)
- Always ask for explicit permission before suggesting any publishing-related actions

## Safe Operations

The following operations are allowed:
- `npm run build` - Building the library
- `npm run dev` - Development mode
- `npm run lint` - Linting code
- `npm run type-check` - TypeScript validation
- `npm run clean` - Cleaning build artifacts

## When Publishing is Discussed

If publishing comes up in conversation:
1. Suggest reviewing the changes first
2. Recommend running tests and validation
3. Ask the user to manually execute publishing commands
4. Never assume publishing should happen automatically
